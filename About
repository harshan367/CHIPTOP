# ChipTop – Physical Design Project

This project implements the **ChipTop module** through a  **ASIC Physical Design (PD) flow**.  
It is focused on learning and practicing industry-standard backend steps like floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis, routing.

## 🚀 Objectives
- Understand FLOORPLAN TO ROUTING flow for ASIC design
- Perform floorplanning, placement, CTS, routing, and optimization
- Build basic knowledge about PD flow.

## 🛠️ Tools & Requirements
- 32nm Technology
- **EDA Tools**:
  - Synopsys ICC2

- **Languages/Scripts**:
  - Tcl (for tool automation)

## 📖 Flow Steps
1. Import netlist, constraints, and library files
2. Floorplanning (define core area, IOs, power planning)
3. Placement (standard cell placement, optimization)
4. CTS (Clock Tree Synthesis)
5. Routing (global + detailed routing)

## 🧪 Results
- Timing closure achieved at target frequency (250 MHz)  
- Final utilization: 0.7307 
- Total power: 1.34e+10 pW
