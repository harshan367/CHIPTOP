A simple Physical Design flow project implemented from floorplanning to routing. The design consists of 4 macros and around 6157 standard cells, with a single clock port operating at 4 ns period (250 MHz). The layout was achieved with 0.70 utilization, and the flow completed successfully with no LVS violations.
